# 🍔 Atomic Food

Atomic Food is a modern food ordering web application where users can browse available meals, add them to the cart, adjust quantities, and place an order through a checkout form.

Inside the cart, users can proceed to checkout, fill in their personal details, and submit the order. The order data, along with the total amount, is sent to a mock backend using a JSON file.

There is no payment integration — payments are intended to be made in cash or via bank transfer, with proof provided outside the application.

The application focuses on simplicity, smooth interactions, and clean animations to deliver a pleasant user experience.
